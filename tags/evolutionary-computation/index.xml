      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Texas A&amp;amp;M, I wanted to get an undergraduate research credit and the only way I knew how was by finding a professor to sponsor you. I remember searching the staff directory for anyone with &amp;lsquo;AI&amp;rsquo; tied to their research and did a cold call email to 20 profs. Two responded and one took me on and I was introduced to the world of research. I definitely felt out of my league, but I think this is the point of this experience so that you have an understanding of the work it takes to publish a paper. My task was to utilize genetic algorithms to explore the problem space that they were studying, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t really think that my project was groundbreaking, I think it was the perfect learning project to become familiar with GAs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
