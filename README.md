ðŸš€ Deployment

This site uses a Hugo static site generator with GitHub Pages.

To deploy:
./deploy.sh

This script does the following:
â€¢ Builds the site with hugo
â€¢ Adds the gh-pages branch as a Git worktree at public/
â€¢ Commits and pushes the contents to gh-pages
â€¢ Removes the public/ worktree after deployment

The gh-pages branch is what GitHub Pages uses to serve the live site at:
https://calebkey121.github.io

Note: If the script errors because public/ already exists or was removed manually, run:
git worktree prune
