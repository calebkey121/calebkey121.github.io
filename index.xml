      <description>&lt;p&gt;It can be a bit overwhelming how ubiquitous AI has become in everyday conversations. When I first started studying AI at Texas A&amp;amp;M, part of the excitement was that it felt like an &amp;ldquo;up-and-coming&amp;rdquo; field, even though, looking back, the signs were already clear that the technology was primed to explode, leading directly to the boom we saw in 2023. You might assume someone beginning their career in AI would feel thrilled that nearly every company is eager to brand itself as an &amp;ldquo;AI company,&amp;rdquo; but truthfully, I miss the simpler days when everyone wasn&amp;rsquo;t talking about whether computers are &amp;ldquo;alive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
