At Texas A&M, I wanted to get an undergraduate research credit and the only way I knew how was by finding a professor to sponsor you. I remember searching the staff directory for anyone with 'AI' tied to their research and did a cold call email to 20 profs. Two responded and one took me on and I was introduced to the world of research. I definitely felt out of my league, but I think this is the point of this experience so that you have an understanding of the work it takes to publish a paper. My task was to utilize genetic algorithms to explore the problem space that they were studying, and while I don't really think that my project was groundbreaking, I think it was the perfect learning project to become familiar with GAs.

The core of my research task was to leverage Genetic Algorithms to investigate a specific optimization problem related to the lab's focus, using CPU cache performance as the application domain. Specifically, I developed a C++ simulation to optimize static cache indexing schemes – the rules determining how memory addresses map to cache sets. This involved not only implementing the Genetic Algorithm itself, exploring various crossover and mutation techniques but also building the LRU cache simulator needed to accurately measure the performance (via eviction counts) of the solutions the GA discovered.

Looking back, while the specific problem was a focused exploration rather than a quest for groundbreaking results, the project was instrumental in my learning journey. It demystified Genetic Algorithms, transforming them from an abstract concept into a tangible tool I could build and manipulate. This hands-on work in C++, coupled with the challenge of designing the simulation and interpreting the results, solidified foundational skills in algorithm implementation, simulation, and empirical analysis that are essential in the broader field of AI/ML.
