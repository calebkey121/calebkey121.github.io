It can be a bit overwhelming how ubiquitous AI has become in everyday conversations. When I first started studying AI at Texas A&M, part of the excitement was that it felt like an "up-and-coming" field, even though, looking back, the signs were already clear that the technology was primed to explode, leading directly to the boom we saw in 2023. You might assume someone beginning their career in AI would feel thrilled that nearly every company is eager to brand itself as an "AI company," but truthfully, I miss the simpler days when everyone wasn't talking about whether computers are "alive."

Still, even I couldn’t predict how rapidly things would evolve. When DALL-E first arrived on the scene, I was genuinely amazed by its capabilities. The image featured in this post perfectly captures that moment—it was the very first image I ever generated: pandas dressed in kimono-style clothing at a market. I love this image precisely because it’s a little abstract, a little artistic, and a little weird. I'm not even sure that they are pandas, but that's what is so fun. It represents image generation at that unique early stage, and it perfectly encapsulates the moment when I realized that something was different.

I think it's really funny that specific style is difficult to replicate today. Modern image generators, while vastly improved, lack the charming imperfections that made those early models special. My recent attempts here to recreate this image, though impressive for what its able to do, feels overly polished compared to the charmingly imperfect original.

If you have me on any social media, messaging app, or game, you might have noticed that I use the original image as my avatar. It’s a constant reminder of where we started, pushing me to contribute something meaningful to the world and inspire others as this technology once did for me.
