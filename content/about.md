Hello, I’m Caleb—a computer engineering professional with a genuine passion for artificial intelligence and innovative problem-solving. My journey began at Texas A&M University, where rigorous courses in calculus and programming ignited a lifelong curiosity about technology. Since graduating Cum Laude, I’ve dedicated myself to exploring how intelligent systems can transform the way we work and live.

In my role at the 90th Cyber Operations Squadron, I’ve had the privilege of contributing to several cutting‑edge projects. Among these, I helped develop NIPRGPT, a premier large language model platform, and created practical tools ranging from real‑time command execution interfaces to AI‑powered translation applications. My work also involves routine collaboration on projects that blend cybersecurity with innovative AI solutions, and I hold an active security clearance as part of my ongoing responsibilities.

Beyond my professional commitments, I enjoy diving into hands‑on projects that push my technical skills further. I built a handwritten digit recognition system using a custom neural network, crafted a C++ program that leverages genetic algorithms to optimize CPU cache performance, and even developed a full‑stack card game driven by reinforcement learning models. Each of these projects has enriched my understanding of AIML and helped me refine my approach to real‑world challenges.

Currently, I am taking part of a prestigious MIT research fellowship as well as pursuing graduate studies in artificial intelligence. My long‑term goal is to advance the field by developing technologies that not only drive industry progress but also have a positive impact on everyday life.

When I’m not immersed in code or research, I love connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts to discuss the future of AI, emerging technologies, and the latest trends in machine learning. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me—I look forward to the exciting journeys ahead in the world of AIML.
