When I first started studying AI at Texas A\u0026amp;M, part of the excitement was that it felt like an \u0026ldquo;up-and-coming\u0026rdquo; field, even though, looking back, the signs were already clear that the technology was primed to explode, leading directly to the boom we saw in 2023. You might assume someone beginning their career in AI would feel thrilled that nearly every company is eager to brand itself as an \u0026ldquo;AI company,\u0026rdquo; but truthfully, I miss the simpler days when everyone wasn\u0026rsquo;t talking about whether computers are \u0026ldquo;alive.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, even I couldn’t predict how rapidly things would evolve. When DALL-E first arrived on the scene, I was genuinely amazed by its capabilities. The image featured in this post perfectly captures that moment—it was the very first image I ever generated: pandas dressed in kimono-style clothing at a market. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure that they are pandas, so please bear with me here :). I love this image precisely because it’s a little abstract, a little artistic, and a little weird. It represents image generation at that unique early stage, and it perfectly encapsulates the moment when I realized that something was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/blogs/pandas_new_1.png\" alt=\"Panda Recreation 1\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it\u0026rsquo;s really funny that specific style is difficult to replicate today. Modern image generators, while vastly improved, lack the charming imperfections that made those early models special. My recent attempts here to recreate this image, though impressive for what its able to do, feels overly polished compared to the charmingly imperfect original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/blogs/pandas_new_2.png\" alt=\"Panda Recreation 2\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have me on any social media, messaging app, or game, you might have noticed that I use the original image as my avatar. It’s a constant reminder of where we started, pushing me to contribute something meaningful to the world and inspire others as this technology once did for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"My first realization that something was different.","image":"/images/blogs/pandas.jpeg","permalink":"https://calebkey121.github.io/blogs/pandas/","title":"Pandas"},{"content":"","description":"Gallery :panda:","image":null,"permalink":"https://calebkey121.github.io/gallery/","title":"Image Gallery"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eAt Texas A\u0026amp;M, I wanted to get an undergraduate research credit and the only way I knew how was by finding a professor to sponsor you. I remember searching the staff directory for anyone with \u0026lsquo;AI\u0026rsquo; tied to their research and did a cold call email to 20 profs. Two responded and one took me on and I was introduced to the world of research. I definitely felt out of my league, but I think this is the point of this experience so that you have an understanding of the work it takes to publish a paper. My task was to utilize genetic algorithms to explore the problem space that they were studying, and while I don\u0026rsquo;t really think that my project was groundbreaking, I think it was the perfect learning project to become familiar with GAs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core of my research task was to leverage Genetic Algorithms to investigate a specific optimization problem related to the lab\u0026rsquo;s focus, using CPU cache performance as the application domain. Specifically, I developed a C++ simulation to optimize static cache indexing schemes – the rules determining how memory addresses map to cache sets. This involved not only implementing the Genetic Algorithm itself, exploring various crossover and mutation techniques but also building the LRU cache simulator needed to accurately measure the performance (via eviction counts) of the solutions the GA discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back, while the specific problem was a focused exploration rather than a quest for groundbreaking results, the project was instrumental in my learning journey. It demystified Genetic Algorithms, transforming them from an abstract concept into a tangible tool I could build and manipulate. This hands-on work in C++, coupled with the challenge of designing the simulation and interpreting the results, solidified foundational skills in algorithm implementation, simulation, and empirical analysis that are essential in the broader field of AI/ML.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"CPU Cache Optimization via Genetic Algorithms","image":"/images/projects/ga.png","permalink":"https://calebkey121.github.io/blogs/ga/","title":"Cache Optimization via GA"}]
